## Well, hello there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on developing a game. I'm attempting to learn how to use Godot as well as developing a discord bot.
You may say that I'm working on too many things, and you're right! But I can't help but want to learn everything. 

- Currently trying to balance work and hobbies
- I like to code, draw, do crafts such as origami, play video games... really, I like to do too many things!
